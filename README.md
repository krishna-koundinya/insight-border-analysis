## Problem
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics regularly makes available data on the number of vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians crossing into the United States by land.

**Generate a csv file containing the total number of times vehicles, equipment, passengers and pedestrians cross the U.S.-Canadian and U.S.-Mexican borders each month and also the running monthly average of total number of crossings for that type of crossing and border.**

## Input Dataset

**The dataset was obtained from Bureau of Transportation Statitics. Source: https://data.transportation.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Border-Crossing-Entry-Data/keg4-3bc2**

## Approach
**Created a dictionary containing data for each border which in turn contains data for each month. Calculated the total number of times a type of vehicle crossed each border each month. Calculated the running monthly average from this dictionary**
